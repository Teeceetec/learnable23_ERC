 #ERC20 Token Contract This repository contains a Solidity smart contract implementation of an ERC20 token. 
The ERC20 standard defines a set of rules and functions that a token contract must implement in order to be compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem.

Features Implements the ERC20 standard interface for token contracts. Supports token transfers, approvals, and allowance management. Constructor function for initializing token properties. Event logging for token transfers and approvals. Getting Started To use this ERC20 token contract in your Ethereum project, follow these steps:

#Deploy the compiled bytecode and ABI to your desired Ethereum network (e.g., local testnet, mainnet).
Interact with the Contract:

Once deployed, you can interact with the ERC20 token contract using Ethereum wallet software (e.g., MetaMask) or custom scripts. Use the contract address and ABI to instantiate the contract object and call its functions.

ERC20 Functions The ERC20 token contract implements the following functions as per the ERC20 standard:

totalSupply: Returns the total token supply. balanceOf: Returns the balance of a given address. transfer: Transfers tokens from the sender's address to the specified recipient. transferFrom: Transfers tokens on behalf of another address. approve: Approves a spender to spend tokens on behalf of the owner. allowance: Returns the allowance for a spender to spend tokens on behalf of the owner.
